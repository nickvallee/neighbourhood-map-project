##Nick's Neighbourhood Map

    This is the Udacity Neighbourhood Map project. I use the **Google Maps API**, the**Wikipedia API** and **KnockoutJS** to build an app that displays popular locations in my neighbourhood, and displays relevant Wikipedia articles about the location, if they exist.

##Features
When you press **show listings** the map will populate with 10 markers on the map. You can filter through the locations with the search bar. As you type, the list of locations and the markers will update. Click **hide listings** to hide all listings.
if you click on a marker or a list item, the marker will bounce and an info window will pop up, showing the location's title and street view.  If there is a Wikipedia article associated with the location, the title will be hyperlinked to the article.

##How to Run Project Locally

    The easiest way to run the project is to navigate to the neighbourhood-map-project folder in the command line and then run **gulp watch**. This will open up the project in the browser. The site will automatically refresh when a file in the project has been edited and saved (using browser sync).
    If **gulp watch** does not work, open **app/index.html
