##Nick's Neighbourhood Map

    This is the Udacity Neighbourhood Map project. I use the **Google Maps API**, and **KnockoutJS** to build an app that displays popular locations in my neightbourhood. I will be adding another API to the project soon.
    The only code that is ever manually edited in the project is in **app/assets**. The **temp** and **doc** have versions of the code that have been filtered through **gulp** and **webpack** build tools.


##How to Run Project Locally

    Ths easiest way to run the project is to navigate to the neighbourhood-map-project folder in the command line and then run **gulp watch**. This will open up the project in the browser. The site will automatically refresh when a file in the project has been edited and saved (with the use of browsers sync).
    If **gulp watch** does not work, open **app/index.html
